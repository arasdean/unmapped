            <h5> Our story begins in Paris.</h5>
            <p>
            We visited the Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Notre Dame, and took a selfie with the Mona Lisa even stopping by the Laduree for some Macaroons. We walked around in awe of a historic city, but it felt empty. That emptiness, is probably what incentivises tourists, too often, to spend most of their time in a new place “comfortable” in their hotel rooms. Luckily for us, there was a local in the City that took it upon herself to show us the Paris she loved! She took us around hidden restaurants and cafe’s packed with French locals. We had the best food since we had arrived!  We spent hours talking about their stories, our stories, perfume/cologne, and yes even bread. The conversations themselves might be a little hazy but the the emotions we felt still resonate with us till today. The experience was more memorable than staring at the Mona Lisa, and yet it was the energy, hospitality, and life of Paris that brought the Marvel of the Mona Lisa to life. Walking through alleyways, along busy streets, engaging with the locals, eating the most delicious food, visiting hidden art galleries, all of these experiences brought a deeper appreciation to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame, etc. We left Paris transformed.

    Everytime we travelled after that, we were in the pursuit of replicating this experience, making friends with locals, inviting them to lunch and dinner, and asking if they had time to show us around their city, even for an hour. We never got a negative response, from Ensenada, to Alhambra to Budapest to Cairo and hopefully in a city near you!
