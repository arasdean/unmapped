            <ul> 
           <li> How do I pay?</li>

            You will be sent an invoice for the first half of your payment after the local initiates the conversation with you. The second half will be charged after the tour so that if you would like to add a tip or if there are any other costs incurred they can be accounted for.
            </ul>
<ul><li>What will my tour of San Francisco encompass? </li>

After choosing your three interests you have the ability to connect with any of our locals. They will curate a custom tour for you based off of their experience in San Francisco. Each tour will be unique and custom tailored for you and your party!
</ul>
<ul> 
<li>Can I trust the Tour Guides?</li>

Every local has been personally vetted by our team to ensure that you will all have a great time. They have also had background checks run as safety is of utmost importance to us.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why should I use Unmapped?</li>
Why should you not? On a serious note, we are giving you an opportunity to immerse yourselves and truly feel a part of San Francisco and the Bay Area. When we asked the guides to give us mock tours not a single one of their tours overlapped and each led to us learning something new about San Francisco whether it was places to check out or restaurants to eat. 
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What does Unmapped mean?</li>
We believe that with the help of these locals we are essentially opening up locations on a map and exposing you to these areas outside of just where they are are located and named. You are now going to be able to learn the stories of these cities and the people residing there.
